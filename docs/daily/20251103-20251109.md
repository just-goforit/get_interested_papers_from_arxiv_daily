  - **Simple LLM Summary:** The paper introduces NOWS, a hybrid approach that uses neural operators to generate high-quality initial guesses for classical iterative PDE solvers. This warm-start strategy significantly reduces iteration counts and computational time by up to 90% while maintaining solver stability and convergence guarantees. The method integrates seamlessly with existing numerical discretizations and preserves the rigor of traditional solvers.
